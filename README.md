# GopherCon 2018 Performance Tuning Workshop

## Instructors

- David Cheney <dave@cheney.net>
- Francesc Campoy <campoy@golang.org>

## Overview

The goal for this workshop is to give you the tools you need to diagnose performance problems in your Go applications and fix them.

Through the day we'll work from the small -- learning how to write benchmarks, then profiling a small piece of code. Then step out and talk about the execution tracer, the garbage collector  and tracing running applications. The remainder of the day will be a chance for you to ask questions, experiment with your own code.
